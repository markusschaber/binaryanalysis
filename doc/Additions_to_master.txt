New options for bat-scan
------------------------

There were two new options added to bat-scan. The -l option is for
passing the path of the blacklist-file to bat-scan. From this file
the scan will read the stringidentifiers, which will be ignored in
the result of bat-scan. The second new option is -w, this option  
allows the user to pass the path to the whitelist to the bat-scan.
From the whitelist-file, bat-scan will read the packages which are
ignored in the scan. The third addition to bat-scan is the postrun-
scan generate overview, this scan will read the json-reports of bat
and generate a json-file which contains all packages matched in the
scan. It also creates a html file whit the same information. Enabl-
ing this scan will cause the postrunscans to run sequencially, the
reason for this is, the requirement of generating the json-reports
before generating the overview. Another change to the scan was made
in the querying of the database, instead of querying only the java
and c stringscaches the scan will now query all caches. This results
in a loss of performance and increases the running time, but it also
increases the amount of packages that can be found by BAT.
